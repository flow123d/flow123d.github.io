<p>List of all changes in user interface and major internal changes.</p>
<h1 id="flow123d-version-1.8.2">Flow123d version 1.8.2</h1>
<p>(2015-03-15)</p>
<h3 id="user-interface">User interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Key DarcyMHOutput/balance_output replaced by DarcyFlowMH/balance.</li>
<li>Key TransportOperatorSplitting/mass_balance replaced by TransportOperatorSplitting/balance.</li>
<li>Key SoluteTransport_DG/mass_balance replaced by SoluteTransport_DG/blance.</li>
<li>Key HeatTransfer_DG/mass_balance replaced by HeatTransfer_DG/balance.</li>
<li>Unified record Balance for configuration of balance output.</li>
<li>New key DarcyFlowMH/gravity to set gravity vector.</li>
<li>All output selections support fields 'region_id' and 'subdomain'.</li>
<li>TransportOperatorSplitting/substances and TransportDG/substances. are arrays of Substance records. Substance record contains substance name and its molar mass. Molar mass is then used in the ReactionTerm.</li>
<li>Key 'molar_mass' removed from Sorption model records.</li>
<li>Reaction term model LinearReactions is replaced by specialized models FirstOrderReaction and RadioactiveDacay Both new models have records with structure similar to the LinearReactions by specialized to the particular physical context. In particular RadioactiveDecayProduct allows specification of the decay energy with in future will be used as a source in the heat equation.</li>
<li>Reaction term model PadeAproximant is now variant of 'ode_solver' used by some reaction models.</li>
<li>Alternative 'ode_solver' is LinearODEAnalytic that was used as default by previous versions.</li>
<li>TimeGovernor is now autoconstructable from the key 'max_dt'.</li>
<li>Meaning of TimeGovernor/init_dt has changed. Newly it is suggestion of the very first time step.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-features">New features</h3>
<ul>
<li>United implementation of balance calculations, fast even for explicit solvers.</li>
<li>Balance output readable by table processors.</li>
<li>SoluteTransport_DG: changes in interpretation of boundary conditions (see manual for current meaning).</li>
<li>Faster BIHTree for search of non-comaptible neighborings.</li>
<li>Continuous integration of all install packages.</li>
<li>Windows installer.</li>
<li>Automatic creation of the output directory.</li>
<li>Faster dual porosity solver.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Memory leak in output classes.</li>
<li>All models now adjust its time steps to match changes of input fields and output times. Several bugs fixed in all models. Added dedicated tests.</li>
<li>Wrong profiler times for the linear solver.</li>
<li>Infinite loop during processing of the --JSON_machine command line argument.</li>
<li>Wrong treatment of possible failure of nonlinear solver in sorption. Missing check of input values.</li>
<li>Binary for 32-bit Windows did not run. (CYGWIN bug)</li>
<li>Resolved instability of inflow/outflow detection in DG solver.</li>
<li>Wrong line numbers in some error messages produced by JSON parser.</li>
<li>Missing error messages on Windows system.</li>
<li>Bugs in non-compatible 2D-1D assembly in DarcyFlowMH.</li>
<li>Radioactive decay should depend on the molar weight (conserve amount of nuclei not mass).</li>
<li>PadeAproximant did not work in parallel.</li>
<li>Wrong mass balance with non-zero reaction term.</li>
<li>Memory leak in LinSys_PETSC.</li>
<li>Fails to read mesh with region ID repeating for regions of different dimension.</li>
</ul>
