        **Transport** - an illustration of concentration propagation through fractured rock<br>
          - 2d model of fractured porous media
          - advection-diffusion equation solved on 1d-2d compatible mesh
          - concentration propagates through the fractures faster than through the bulk rock

        **Transport solver** - comparison of different methods<br>
          - 1d problem with moving concentration peak
          - Finite volumes - piecewise constant solution, large numerical diffusion can be observed
          - Finite elements - piecewise linear solution,  some oscillations are present
          - Discontinuous Galerkin - piecewise linear solution,  no oscillations and minimal diffusion
