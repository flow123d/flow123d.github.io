<h2>XFEM method for modelling wells</h2>

<p>
  Using XFEM method we are able to describe precisely point sources in 2D domains or 
  1D sources in 3D domains which is necessary for modeling interaction between continuum 
  and active or abandoned wells. Conceptual study proved efficiency of the XFEM method in 
  comparison to the adaptive FEM method both in the terms of number of elements as in the 
  overall computational time. Implementation of the method in Flow123d is in development.

<h2>Equation Coupling on Non-compatible Meshes</h2>

<p>
   Flow123d have partial support for coupling Darcy flow on non-compatible meshes.
   In particular, the 2D-1D coupling was successfully tested. 
   In the <a href="http://www.iam.fmph.uniba.sk/algoritmy2012/zbornik/21Brezina.pdf">paper</a>,
   we have demonstrated optimal order of convergence for the error in the pressure field. 
   The velocity field can not be precisely captured on the non-compatible mesh without further post-processing.

<h2>Poroelasticity</h2>

Elasticity model is in development as well as coupling of the elasticity and Darcy flow in Biot's model.
Elasticity model will support coupling between dimensions.
