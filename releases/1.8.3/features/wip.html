<h2>XFEM method for modelling wells</h2>

<p>
  Using XFEM method we are able to describe precisely point sources in 2D domains or 1D sources in 3D domains which is necessary for modelling interaction between continuum and active or abandoned wells. Conceptual study proved efficiency of the XFEM method in comparison to the adaptive FEM method both in the terms of number of elements as in the overall computational time. Implementation of the method in Flow123d is in development.

<h2>Equation Coupling on Non-compatible Meshes</h2>

<p>
   Flow123d have partial support for coupling Darcy flow on non-compatible meshes. In particular, the 2D-1D coupling was successfully tested. In the <a href="http://www.iam.fmph.uniba.sk/algoritmy2012/zbornik/21Brezina.pdf">paper</a>, we have demonstrated optimal order of convergence for the error in the pressure field. The velocity field can not be precisely captured on the non-compatible mesh without further post-processing.

<h2>Scalable BDDC Solver</h2>

<p>
   In cooperation with Jakub Sistek, we have adopted multi-level balancing domain decomposition by constrains, namely its package <a href="http://www.math.cas.cz/~sistek/software/bddcml.html">BDDCML</a>. We have demonstrated strong scaling on real Darcy flow problems up to 1000 processors, see <a href="http://bacula.nti.tul.cz/~jan.brezina/flow123d_publications/bddc_hybrid.pdf">the preprint</a>.
