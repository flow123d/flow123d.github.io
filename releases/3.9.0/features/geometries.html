<h2>Complex geometries consisting of elements of different dimensions</h2>

<p>
  Flow123d can handle meshes consisting of simplicial elements of different dimensions.
  This allows various combinations of the continuum (3D) models with discrete fracture network (2D and 1D) models.
  The compatible meshes, i.e. elements of the lower dimension match sides of the elements of the higher dimension,
  are considered.
  Currently, only simplicial meshes produced by the software GMSH are supported.

   Effective algorithms searching for intersections of incompatible meshes were introduced in this
   <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122117300792">publication</a>.
   These algorithms are only used in some experimental parts of codes for XFEM and Mortar methods in Darcy flow.
