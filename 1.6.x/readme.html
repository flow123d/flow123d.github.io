How to install and run Flow123
==============================

==============
Prerequisities
==============

If you are running Windows, you have to install 'cygwin' for
emulation of POSIX unix environment.

For build you will need some developement software packages. On
Windows use cygwin to install them. On Linux use package manager
of your distribution ('apt-get' for Ubuntu and Debian, 'yum' for
RedHat and Centos)

requested packages are: 

* gcc, g++, gfortran    C/C++ compiler and Fortran77 compiler for
                        compilation of BLAS library.
* python, perl, cmake   Scripting languages and building tool
* boost                 C++ library

optionaly you may want also:

* doxygen, graphviz     source generated documentation and its
                        supprot tool for diagrams.
* eclipse + CDT (C/C++ developement toolkit)   

You can find complete set of usefull libraries compatible with
Flow123d on address:

http://dev.nti.tul.cz/jan.brezina/flow_libs (check)

==============================
Step 1 - Install PETSc Library
==============================

Flow branches up to 1.6.5 depends on the PETSC library 3.0.0-xx.
Download this version from:

http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/installation.html

Assume that you unpack the installation tree to the directory:

/home/jb/local/petsc

Change to this directory and set this as your PETSC directory:
> export PETSC_DIR=`pwd`

For developelemt you will need at least debuging and production build
of the library. First set a name for the debugging configuration:
> export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gcc-dbg

And run the configuration script, for example with following options:
>./config/configure.py --with-debugging=1 --with-cc=gcc \
 --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --CFLAGS_O=-g --FFLAGS_O=-g \
 --download-mpich=yes --download-parmetis=yes \
 --download-f-blas-lapack=1 --with-x=1

This also automagically install BLAS, Lapack, MPICH, and ParMetis so
it takes a while, it can be about 15 min. If everything is OK, you
obtain table with used compilers and libraries. Finally compile PETSC
with this configuration:
> make all

To test the compilation run:
> make test

To obtain PETSC configuration for the production version you
can use e.g.

> export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gcc-dbg
>./config/configure.py --with-debugging=0 --with-cc=gcc \
 --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=gfortran --CFLAGS_O=-O3 --FFLAGS_O=-O3 \
 --download-mpich=yes --download-parmetis=yes \
 --download-f-blas-lapack=1 --with-x=1
> make all
> make test

Configurations mentioned abouve are minimalistic. Next we describe
several additional cofigure options whic can be usefull.


Alternatives and Troubleshooting
================================



1) If you want only serial version of PETSc (and Flow123d)
add --with-mpi=0 to the configure command line.
You can have several PETSC configuration using different PETSC_ARCH.

2) By default PETSC will create dynamicaly linked libraries, which
can be shared be more applications. But on some systems 
(in particular we have problems under Windows) this doesn't work,
so one is forced to turn off dynamic linking by:

--with-shared=0

3) PETSC use BLAS and few LAPCAK functions for its local vector and
matrix operations. The speed of BLAS and LAPACK have dramatic impact 
on the overall performance. There is a sophisicated implementation
of BLAS called ATLAS. ATLAS performs extensive set of performance
tests on your hardware then make an optimized imlementation of 
BLAS code for you. Accoring to our measurements the Flow123d is
about two times faster with ATLAS compared to
usual --download-f-blas-lapack (on x86 architecture and usin GCC).
   
In order to use ATLAS, download it from ... and follow their
instructions. The key point is that you have to turn off the CPU
throttling. To this end install 'cpufreq-set' or `cpu-freq-selector`
and use it to set your processor to maximal performance:

> cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance
> cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance

.. this way I have set performance mode for both cores of my Core2Duo.

Then you need not to specify any special options, just run default
configuration and make. 
   
Unfortunately, there is one experimental preconditioner in PETSC
(PCASA) which use a QR decomposition Lapack function, that is not
part of ATLAS. Although it is possible to combine ATLAS with full
LAPACK from Netlib, we rather provide an empty QR decomposition
function as a part of Flow123d sources.
See. HAVE_ATTLAS_ONLY_LAPACK in ./makefile.in

4) PETSC provides interface to many usefull packages. You can install them 
adding further configure options:
--download-superlu=yes         # parallel direct solver
--download-hypre=yes           # Boomer algebraic multigrid
                               # preconditioner, many preconditioners
--download-spools=yes          # parallel direc solver
--download-blacs=ifneeded      # needed by MUMPS
--download-scalapack=ifneeded  # needed by MUMPS
--download-mumps=yes           # parallel direct solver
--download-umfpack=yes         # MATLAB solver

 Step 2 - Armadillo
=========================

.. under construction.

=========================
 Step 3 - DUNE
=========================

... under construction

=========================
 Step 4 - Compile Flow123
=========================

Get appropriate branch from repository. "trunk_serial" should be
stable, "branches/1.6.0_modular" 
is actual development branch.

Copy file  makefile.in.template to makefile.in:
> cp makefile.in.template makefile.in

Edit file makefile.in, set your PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH.

Uncomment setting for "USE_PARALLEL" if you want a parallel version.
To this end you need PETSC with treu MPI (not --with-mpi=0) and with\
ParMETIS library. Alternatively you can install ParMETIS yourself
and provide its location in variables: PARMETIS_INCLUDE,
PARMETIS_LIB (as indicated in makefile.in.template)

Finally you can specify the C++ compiler and its options. Otherwise
we use PETSC setting.
e.g. for GCC:
CPP=g++
CFLAGS= -O3

Then run the compilation by:
> make all

For further information about program usage see documentation
in "doc/" in particular reference manual "doc/flow_doc".
