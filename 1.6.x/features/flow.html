<h1>
  Darcian Flow in Fractured Porous Media
</h1>

<p>
  We use mixed-hybrid finite element method for solving Darcy flow problems with 3D-2D and 2D-1D coupling between meshes of different dimensions. For compatible meshes, the pressure can be different on both sides of 2D fracture (or on arbitrary number of 2D manifolds connected to a 1D channel). The advantage of the mixed-hybrid formulation is better approximation of the velocity field. According to theoretical results and practical tests this method provides second order convergence of the L2-error for both the pressure and the velocity field. More over the velocity field is perfectly mass conservative.

  Hybridization leads to linear systems, where two successive Schur complements can be explicitly formed in efficient way, thus the resulting system is positive definite and well conditioned.

  Flow123d can also calculate unstedy Darcian flow in the case of the non-zero storativity. Particular mass luming technique is used in order to guarantee the discrete maximum principle (no overshoots).
