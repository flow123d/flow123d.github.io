<h1>
  Input and Output Interface
</h1>

<p>
  Main input file is in JSON file format with few optional simplifications to make it more convenient for humans. Whole input structure is described by particular classes which provides automatically generated documentation of the whole input structure. This structure more or less follows the structure of main program classes.
</p>

<p>
  Almost all parameters in equations can be given as arbitrary space-time fields. There are several types of fields that differs in the way how they are represented on the input. Actually we support: constant field, field given by runtime parsed formula, fields given by a Python code, fields piecewise constant per element, fields interpolated from a different 3D mesh.
</p>

<p>
  Any output field can be written either in VTK file format or in the GMSH file format.
