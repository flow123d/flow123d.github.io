Novelty of this software is support of computations on complex\r\nmeshes consisting of simplicial elements of different dimensions. Therefore\r\nwe can combine continuum models and discrete fracture network models.\r\n\r\nCurrent version includes mixed-hybrid solver for steady and unsteady Darcy's\r\nflow, finite volume model for transport of several substances. Using operator\r\nsplitting we support models for various local processes including dual\r\nporosity, sorption, decays and reactions.\r\n\r\nAll computations can be run in parallel using PETSc and MPI. However, the\r\nmesh data and output operations are still sequential. Program supports output\r\ninto VTK format for visualization and postprocessing in Paraview. \r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\n* [Source documentation](http://ci2.nti.tul.cz/job/make_doc/doxygen/)\r\n* [Reference manual](http://ci2.nti.tul.cz/job/make_doc/doclinks/1/)\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\nThe source code of Flow123d is licensed under GPL3 license.
