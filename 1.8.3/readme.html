<p>Flow123d is a simulator of underground water flow and transport processes in fractured porous media. Novelty of this software is support of computations on complex meshes consisting of simplicial elements of different dimensions. Therefore we can combine continuum models and discrete fracture network models. For more information see the project pages: <a href="http://flow123d.github.com">flow123d.github.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="windows-os-prerequisities">Windows OS prerequisities</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows, you have to install <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> for emulation of POSIX unix environment (both 32-bit and 64-bit version should work). Then all what follows has to be done in the directories under cygwin, e.g &quot;C:&quot; and within the cygwin shell. In addition to the packages mentioned for the Linux you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>openssh (for MPICH)</li>
<li>some editor that can save Unix like text files (eg. notepad+ or sublime)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linux-os-prerequisities">Linux OS prerequisities</h3>
<p>Requested packages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>gcc, g++ C/C++ compiler in version 4.7 and higher (we use C++11)</li>
<li>gfortran Fortran compiler for compilation of BLAS library for PETSc.</li>
<li>python, perl Scripting languages</li>
<li>make, cmake (&gt;2.8.8), patch Building tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended packages for development: * libboost General purpose C++ library</p>
<p>Namely you need development version of the Boost sub-libraries: &quot;Program Options&quot;, &quot;Serialize&quot;, &quot;Regex&quot;, and &quot;Filesystem&quot;. In Debian/Ubuntu distributions, these are in separate packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>libboost-program-options-dev</li>
<li>libboost-serialize-dev</li>
<li>libboost-regex-dev</li>
<li>libboost-filesystem-dev</li>
</ul>
<p>Flow123d downloads and installs Boost during configuration if it is not found in the system, but it may take long. Optionally you may need</p>
<ul>
<li>doxygen, graphviz for source generated documentation and its dependency diagrams</li>
<li>texlive-latex or other Latex package to build reference manual, we use also some extra packages: on RedHat type distributions you may need texlive-cooltooltips, on Debian/Ubuntu texlive-latex-extra</li>
<li>imagemagick tool is used to generate some graphics for the reference manual</li>
</ul>
<p>Flow123d depends also on PETSc library. It can be installed automatically during configuration, but for good parallel performance it has to be configured manually see appropriate section later on.</p>
<h3 id="compile-flow123">Compile Flow123</h3>
<p>Copy file <code>config.cmake.template</code> to <code>config.cmake</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cp config.cmake.template config.cmake</code></pre>
<p>Edit file <code>config.cmake</code>, set <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> variables if you have your own installation of PETSc. For further options see comments in the template file.</p>
<p>Then run the compilation by:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; make all</code></pre>
<p>This runs configuration and then the build process. If the configuration fails and you need to correct your <code>config.cmake</code> or other system setting you have to cleanup all files generated by unsuccessful cmake configuration by:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; make clean-all</code></pre>
<p>Try this every time if your build doesn't work and you don't know why.</p>
<p>** Parallel builds **</p>
<p>Build can take quite long time when running on single processor. Use make's parameter '-j N' to use N parallel processes. Developers can set appropriate alias in '.bashrc', e.g. :</p>
<pre><code>export NUMCPUS=`grep -c &#39;^processor&#39; /proc/cpuinfo`
alias pmake=&#39;time nice make -j$NUMCPUS --load-average=$NUMCPUS&#39;</code></pre>
<h3 id="manual-petsc-installation-optional">Manual PETSc installation (optional)</h3>
<p>Flow versions 1.8.x depends on the PETSC library 3.4.x. It is installed automatically if you do not set an existing installation in <code>config.cmake</code> file. However the manual installation is necessary if - you want to switch between more configurations (debugging, release, ...) using <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> variable. - you want to achieve best performance configuring with system-wide MPI and/or BLAS and LAPACK libraries.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>download PETSc 3.4.x from: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/documentation/installation.html</p></li>
<li><p>unpack to any working directory and go to it, eg. :</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd /home/jb/local/petsc</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Set variables:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; export PETSC_DIR=`pwd`</code></pre>
<p>For development you will need at least debugging build of the library. Set the name of configuration, eg. :</p>
<pre><code>&gt; export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gcc-dbg</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run the configuration script, for example with following options:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ./config/configure.py --with-debugging=1 --CFLAGS-O=-g --FFLAGS-O=-g \
  --download-mpich=yes --download-metis=yes --download-parmetis --download-f-blas-lapack=1</code></pre>
<p>This also force cofigurator to install BLAS, Lapack, MPICH, and ParMetis so it takes a while (it could take about 15 min). If everything is OK, you obtain table with used compilers and libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally compile PETSC with this configuration:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; make all</code></pre>
<p>To test the compilation run:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; make test</code></pre>
<p>To obtain PETSC configuration for the production version you can use e.g.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; export PETSC_ARCH=linux-gcc-dbg
&gt; ./config/configure.py --with-debugging=0 --CFLAGS-O=-O3 --FFLAGS-O=-O3 \
   --download-mpich=yes --download-metis=yes --download-f-blas-lapack=1
&gt; make all
&gt; make test</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can have several PETSC configuration using different <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> value.</li>
<li>For some reasons if you let PETSc to download and install its own MPICH it overrides your optimization flags for compiler. Workaround is to edit file <code>${PETSC_DIR}/${PETSC_ARCH}/conf/petscvariables</code> and modify variables <code>&lt;complier&gt;_FLAGS_O</code> back to the values you wish.</li>
<li>PETSc configuration should use system wide MPI implementation for efficient parallel computations.</li>
<li>You have to compile PETSc at least with Metis support.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-for-other-libraries">Support for other libraries</h3>
<p>PETSc supports lot of other software packages. Use <code>configure.py --help</code> for the full list. Here we highlight the packages we are familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MKL</strong> is implementation of BLAS and LAPACK libraries provided by Intel for their processors. Usually gives the best performance. Natively supported by PETSc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ATLAS library</strong> PETSC use BLAS and few LAPACK functions for its local vector and matrix operations. The speed of BLAS and LAPACK have dramatic impact on the overall performance. There is a sophisticated implementation of BLAS called ATLAS. ATLAS performs extensive set of performance tests on your hardware then make an optimized implementation of BLAS code for you. According to our measurements the Flow123d is about two times faster with ATLAS compared to usual --download-f-blas-lapack (on x86 architecture and usin GCC).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to use ATLAS, download it from ... and follow their instructions. The key point is that you have to turn off the CPU throttling. To this end install 'cpufreq-set' or <code>cpu-freq-selector</code> and use it to set your processor to maximal performance:</p>
<pre><code>cpufreq-set -c 0 -g performance
cpufreq-set -c 1 -g performance</code></pre>
<p>... this way I have set performance mode for both cores of my Core2Duo.</p>
<p>Then you need not to specify any special options, just run default configuration and make.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is one experimental preconditioner in PETSC (PCASA) which use a QR decomposition Lapack function, that is not part of ATLAS. Although it is possible to combine ATLAS with full LAPACK from Netlib, we rather provide an empty QR decomposition function as a part of Flow123d sources. See. HAVE_ATTLAS_ONLY_LAPACK in ./makefile.in</p>
<ul>
<li>PETSC provides interface to many useful packages. You can install them adding further configure options:</li>
</ul>
<p>--download-superlu=yes # parallel direct solver --download-hypre=yes # Boomer algebraic multigrid preconditioner, many preconditioners --download-spools=yes # parallel direc solver --download-blacs=ifneeded # needed by MUMPS --download-scalapack=ifneeded # needed by MUMPS --download-mumps=yes # parallel direct solver --download-umfpack=yes # MATLAB solver</p>

<h2 id="build-the-reference-manual">Build the reference manual</h2>
<p>The reference manual can be built by</p>
<pre><code>&gt; make ref-doc</code></pre>
<p>which calls LaTeX commands to make the final pdf file <code>doc/reference_manual/flow123d_doc.pdf</code>. The LaTeX source files depends on several packages that are needed for succesful build. In the list below we provide a hint to find these packages (and names of distribution packages if you are using TeXLive under Ubuntu):</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Petsc Detection Problem:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>CMake try to detect type of your PETSc installation and then test it by compiling and running simple program. However, this can fail if the program has to be started under 'mpiexec'. In such a case, please, set:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; set (PETSC_EXECUTABLE_RUNS YES)</code></pre>
<p>in your makefile.in.cmake file, and perform: <code>make clean-all; make all</code></p>
<p>For further information about program usage see reference manual <code>doc/flow_doc</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>** Shared libraries ** By default PETSC will create dynamically linked libraries, which can be shared be more applications. But on some systems (in particular we have problems under Windows) this doesn't work, so one is forced to turn off dynamic linking by:</p>
<p>--with-shared=0</p></li>
<li><p>** No MPI ** If you want only serial version of PETSc (and Flow123d) add --with-mpi=0 to the configure command line.</p></li>
<li><p>** Windows line ends** If you use a shell script for PETSC configuration under cygwin, always check if you use UNIX line ends. It can be specified in the notepad of Windows 7.</p></li>
<li><p>** older Windows ** For some older Windows versions it may be necessary to set in configuration of PETSC --with-timer=nt</p></li>
<li><p>** Cygwin remap problem ** You may get strange errors during configuration of PETSc, like</p>
<p>C:.exe: *** unable to remap C:.dll to same address as parent(0xDF0000) != 0xE00000</p></li>
</ul>
<p>or other errors usually related to DLL conflicts. (see http://www.tishler.net/jason/software/rebase/rebase-2.4.2.README) To fix DLL libraries you should perform:</p>
<p>-# shutdown all Cygwin processes and services -# start <code>ash</code> (do not use bash or rxvt) -# execute <code>/usr/bin/rebaseall</code> (in the ash window)</p>
<p>Possible problem with 'rebase': /usr/lib/cygicudata.dll: skipped because nonexist . . . FixImage (/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll) failed with last error = 13</p>
<p>Solution (ATTENTION, depends on Cygwin version): add following to line 110 in the rebase script: -e '//sys-root/mingw/bin/d'</p>
